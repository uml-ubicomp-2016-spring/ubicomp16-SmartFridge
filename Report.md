# Goal
 Since now is a time where most of the people upgrade their phones once a year, we are left with one a lot of unused mobile phones around, So we came up with an idea to put the phone to use by a smart way to detect who is using the fridge by utilizing the sensors and modules, and applying what we have learned in the class. Thus, by mounting the phone on the fridge using a dualside magnet and detect the Door opening and capture the face of the person using the camera and show the results in the web application.   <br/>

#  Features
The app is simple and efficent since it uses an optimal way to detect the door status and an efficent algorithm to detect the faces from the camera source. The app flow starts by mounting the phone in potrait mode to the fridge and Starting the Smart Fridge App. The app greets you with a status of the door and holds the screen for you, Once the door is opened the app launches the face detection Activity where it detects your face and saves it, then the Upload service will upload the images to the web application. When opened the web application the users will be prompted to register if they are first time users or they will be prompted for login if they have been registered, On login the activity page will display the all the user actvity. So User can monitor all the actvities using the web Application.
